# cuffless-bp-estimation
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for cuffless blood pressure estimation, which can provide accurate and non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure without the need for traditional cuff-based measurements. We have used CNN-LSTM combination to predict the BP, and predict CVD risk.
